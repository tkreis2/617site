                | "After moving to a new city and starting a stressful new job, I turned to
                | food for comfort. Over the course of 6 months, I gained 70 pounds and
                | weighed more than I ever had. I was depressed, and knew what I needed to do
                | to make a change, but couldn't get motivated. A friend from my hometown was
                | experiencing a similar struggle when we found HealthWe. Together, we've lost
                | 100 pounds combined in 8 months, thanks to HealthWe! I'm so glad I found this
                | tool."

                | "I have never enjoyed exercising, and while I'm not overweight, I've never
                | been fit. After a health scare, I realized that I needed to adopt a workout
                | routine to get stronger and healthier. I partnered with my coworker and my
                | sister to develop and stick to an exercise schedule. It's been 3 months,
                | and I now workout for an average of 6 hours a week. This tool was a
                | game-changer because I was truly held accountable for my actions, and my
                | coworker and sister have supported me the whole time!"
